London; whereas a few years later the combined fleets of England and France, when attempting a landing in
holland, were foiled by the difficulties of the coast as much as by the valor of the Dutch fleet. In 1778 the
harbor of New York, and with it undisputed control of the Hudson River, would have been lost to the English,
who were caught at disadvantage, but for the hesitancy of the French admiral. With that control, New England
would have been restored to close and safe communication with New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania;
and this blow, following so closely on Burgoyne's disaster of the year before, would probably have led the
English to make an earlier peace. The Mississippi is a mighty source of wealth and strength to the United
States; but the feeble defenses of its mouth and the number of its subsidiary streams penetrating the country
made it a weakness and source of disaster to the Southern Confederacy. And lastly, in 1814, the occupation of
the Chesapeake and the destruction of Washington gave a sharp lesson of the dangers incurred through the
noblest waterâˆ’ways, if their approaches be undefended; a lesson, recent enough to be easily recalled, but
which, from the present appearance of the coast defenses, seems to be yet more easily forgotten. Nor should it
be thought that conditions have changed; circumstances and details of offence and defence have been
modified, in these days as before, but the great conditions remain the same.
